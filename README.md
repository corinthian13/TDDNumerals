# TDDNumerals

This is a small Java program converting year dates in Arabic numerals into their equivalent Roman numeral form.
For example, the year 1916 AD will be converted to its Roman equivalent, MCMXVI AD.

This program was developed according to the test-driven development (TDD) cycle. 
So before any new code is added, one or more test cases are assigned to validate the new code.
As this is a Java program, JUnit is used to set the test cases.
